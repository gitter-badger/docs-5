# Installation

GeekAddons templates requires two major parts to function. The first is the Gantry 5 framework, the second is the template itself.
The installation process is the same for each of these. Please note that the Gantry 5 framework should be installed prior to a template.

Navigate to **Extension - Manage - Install** and select **Chose File** button.
Locate the Gantry Framework (named similarly to pkg_gantry5-v5.0.0.zip) and click **Upload & Install** button.

Repeat this steps to install GeekAddons Templates.

Navigate to **Extension - Manage - Install** and select **Chose File** button.
Locate the Template (named similarly to ga_goomla.zip) and click **Upload & Install** button.

If you are using the GeekAddons template, you will want to set it as default template. Navigate to **Extensions - Manage**, select the template checkbox, and click **Default** in the button toolbar.
