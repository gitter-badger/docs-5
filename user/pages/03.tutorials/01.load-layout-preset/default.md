# Load Layout Preset

GeekAddons templates comes with **Layout Presets** that allows you to quickly switch between pre-configured layouts for your site.

Navigate to **Extensions - Templates**, select GeekAddons template, and switch to **Layout** tab. Once you select **Load** button, a pop-up containing two tabs, Presets and Outlines, will appear. Select the desired Preset.

The **Keep the current Particles** options allows you to keep your currently Particles while changing the Layout. If you want to load a new preset, that contain its own Particles, uncheck this option.
