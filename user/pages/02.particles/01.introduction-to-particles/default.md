# Introduction to Particles

Gantry Framework added a new concept called Particles. They are similar to Modules , allowing you to quickly configure the Layout of your site.

There are three basic types of Particles:

Standard Particles (e.g. Branding, Logo),
Positions are block that can have content or scripting assigned to them by the CMS (e.g. Page Content, Module Position),
Atoms are non - visible Particles, will not visually render on front end (e.g. Custom CSS/JS, Google Analytics).

**Particle Settings**

Accessing the Particle Settings is pretty simple, just select the settings icon for the particle you wish to adjust. A popup will appear with two tabs, Particle and Block.

Particle tab contain specific fields, could be a text input, image picker, icon picker and so on.
Block tab is common for all particles. Here you can assign a CSS ID, CSS Class, predefined Variations, add Tag Attributes, or set the particle size (the width in the row).
